# Questionnaire Demo
This is a small Vue.js app for demonstrating the [`@i4mi/fhir_questionnaire` package](../README.md).

## How to run the demo app locally:
First, point your terminal to this directory. Then run the following command to install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
After installing the dependencies, you can run the dev server with `npm run dev` and point your browser to the displayed localhost address (in most cases, it is [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)).
