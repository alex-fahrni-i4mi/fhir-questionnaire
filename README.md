# I4MI Questionnaire Data
QuestionnaireData is a class that facilitates the rendering and handling of FHIR Questionnaires in TypeScript / Javascript applications.
‚ùóÔ∏è Please be aware that this is currently work in progress. 
‚ùóÔ∏è Not all features of FHIR Questionnaire are supported, and a lot of functionality is not yet documented. 
‚ùóÔ∏è There are probably minor and major bugs (if you find one - [let me know!](mailto:heg2@bfh.ch)).
‚ùóÔ∏è We do not recommend using this for production projects.
‚ùóÔ∏è The class is based on the FHIR R4 (4.0.1) version of the Questionnaire ressource.

See also the documentation of the [FHIR Questionnaire](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaire.html) and [FHIR QuestionnaireResponse](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaireresponse.html) ressources.
## Basic use
### Setup
For every questionnaire you want to handle, you need to initialize a QuestionnaireData instance, providing the FHIR questionnaire resource as a JSON object, and at least one shorthand for an available language:
```typescript
const qData = new QuestionnaireData(fhirQuestionnaire, ['en']);
```
//TODO: describe additional options

### Rendering of the questions
You can then use the QuestionnaireData instance to get the items and render them. You have to implement the rendering for every Question type the questionnaire you're using has, since a "choice" question needs to be rendered differently than a "free text" question. 
In a Vue.js app, this could look something like that (please mind that this is a very basic example and does not take into account more complicated use cases like nested questions):
```html
<div v-for="question in qData.getQuestions()"
     :key="question.id">
  <div v-if="question.isEnabled"
       :class="'question-' + question.type + (question.isInvalid ? ' invalid' : '')">
    <h2>
      {{ question.label[lang] }}
    </h2>
    <!-- CHOICE question -->
    <ul v-if="question.type === 'choice'">
      <li v-for="answer in question.answerOptions"
          :key="question.id + '-' + answer.code"
          @click="qData.updateQuestionAnswers(question, answer)">
        <input type="radio"
               :checked="qData.isAnswerOptionSelected(question, answer)"
               :name="question.id"
               :id="answer.code.toString()" />
        <label for="answer.code.toString()">
          {{ answer.answer[lang] }}
        </label>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- implement other question types-->
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

### Retrieving the QuestionnaireResponse
The QuestionnaireResponse can be retrieved with the `getQuestionnaireResponse()` method. You need to provide a language shorthand, which must be one of the shorthands you provided as available language in the constructor when setting up the QuestionnaireData instance.
`getQuestionnaireResponse()` checks the answers for validity, and throws an error if one question has not a valid answer (the first invalid question is then marked with isInvalid=true, so you can give this feedback to the user). For this reason, it is recommended to wrap this in a try/catch block. For detailed options of `getQuestionnaireResponse()`, see below.
```typescript
try {
  const response = qData.getQuestionnaireResponse('en');
} catch(e) {
  console.warn('Something ain\'t right:', e);
}
```

## Interfaces
### IQuestion
Every Questionnaire item is converted to a IQuestion, which makes handling it easier. It has the following properties. 
//TODO: differ which elements are useful for rendering, and which are only internal
- **id** (string): Corresponds to the linkId of the Questionnaire item
- **type** (QuestionnaireItemType from @i4mi/fhir_r4): The type of the question
- **label** ({[language: string]: string): The label / question of the string, with strings in every available language (with fallback strings if the Questionnaire does not have the language available)
- **prefix** (string): The prefix of the question, often the number of the question in the questionnaire
- **answerOptions** (IAnswerOption[], see below): The answer options, for example for choice questions.
- **required** (boolean): Describes if the question needs to be answered.
- **allowsMultipleAnswers** (boolean): Describes if multiple answers are allowed (not applicable for every type of question)
- **isEnabled** (boolean): Describes if a question is enabled and should be displayed to the user. This is for example used for questions that are depending on other questions and are only enabled when the other question is answered in a certain way.
- **readOnly**: (boolean): Describes if a question is read only and should not be changed by the user. You should take this into account when rendering your questions.
- **selectedAnswers** (QuestionnaireResponseItemAnswer[], see below): Array of none to multiple answers the user has selected / given to the question.
- **subItems**? (IQuestion[]): A question of type GROUP, but also other question, can have nested subquestions (which again, can have subquestions).
- **relatedResourceId** (string): //TODO: I have no idea myself what this does ü§ì
- **isInvalid** (boolean): Indicates if the answer(s) to a question are invalid. This is not updated in real time, but on `getQuestionaireResponse()`
- **initial** (QuestionnaireItemInitial[] from @i4mi/fhir_r4): Initial value of the item.
- **options** (IQuestionOptions, see below): Options for this item.
- **dependingQuestionsEnableBehaviour** ('ALL' or 'ANY'): Describes if all of the criteria below must be fulfilled to enable a depending question, or if one criteria is enough.
- **dependingQuestions**: Links depending questions to this question. Depending questions are activated if the criteria are matched.

### IAnswerOption
Answer options conform to this interface:
- **answer** ({[language: string]: string}): The actual answer string, in possible different languages.
- **code** (QuestionnaireResponseItemAnswer from @i4mi/fhir_r4): The actual coding of the answer
- **disableOtherAnswers**: Determines which other answers are unselected if this answer is selected (in multiple choice questions).

### IQuestionOptions
All of the options are optional.
//TODO: description
- **controlType** (ItemControlType):
- **min** (number):
- **max** (number):
- **sliderStep** (number):
- **unit** (Coding):
- **format** (string):
- **initialExpression** (string):
- **calculatedExpression** (string):

## Methods
### serialize(): string
